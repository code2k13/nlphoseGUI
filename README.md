![](images/drag_drop_nlphose.gif)

This tool is a graphical pipeline builder for [nlphose]( https://github.com/code2k13/nlphos) pipelines. You can use the [Blockly based](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) GUI editor in any browser to create complex NLP pipelines. As you create a pipeline it shows you the corresponding nlphose command which will execute the pipeline.
